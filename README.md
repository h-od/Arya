# Arya

This repository is for Arya's coding test. It has been built using Android's best practices using Kotlin & Jetpack Compose. 

Functionality is limited as the focus is UI representation. 

There are two dynamic elements:
- Clicking the plus button opens a message addition overlay
- The send message button appears only when there is message input from the user.

Additional libraries used: 
- [Haze](https://chrisbanes.github.io/haze/latest/) by Chris Banes to achieve the required blur in the message addition overlay.
